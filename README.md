# WINDOWS-ASA-INI
This repository will house my work-in-progress INI / cheat client for windows 10/microsoft store ARK: Survival Ascended

# FEATURES 

This client will feature many INI settings such as:

- No tree INI
- No water INI
- No mesh INI (literally walls)
- No shadow INI
- Hard INI (a combination from a selection above)
- Potato INI (Hard ini, with no particles)
- Auto gamma correction
- Toggleable speedhacks/rapidfire
  
# NOTICES

- As of recent wildcard announcements, an anticheat may be implemented into ASA on windows. This would practically render this INI useless as it would instantly be detected and trigger a ban on execution. For now though, it will work just fine.

- This software is for the Microsoft store edition of ASA, DO NOT attempt to run this with steam ark, you WILL be instantly banned.

- This software is for single-player only, never use it on an official or unofficial server without explicit permission from the server owner / moderator
